## What is TapTrust?

TapTrust is an AI assistant designed from the ground up with privacy as the core principle. Unlike traditional AI services where your conversations are stored and processed on company servers, TapTrust ensures that only you can access your conversations.

Your messages are encrypted on your device before they're sent anywhere, and the AI processing happens in secure, isolated environments that prevent even TapTrust from seeing your data.
