## Privacy & Security

### How does TapTrust's privacy model compare to ChatGPT, Claude, and Google's Gemini?

**TapTrust provides fundamentally superior privacy through technical enforcement rather than policy promises.**

Unlike ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, which rely on corporate policies and cloud security to protect your data, TapTrust uses cryptographic enforcement that makes it technically impossible for anyone—including TapTrust—to access your conversations.

#### Consumer Versions (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)
- **Data Usage**: Your conversations are used to train and improve AI models by default
- **Access**: Company employees can access your conversations for moderation and training
- **Storage**: Your data is stored in plaintext on company servers
- **Privacy**: Relies on company promises and policies

#### Enterprise Versions
- **No Training**: Enterprise customers can opt out of model training
- **Access Controls**: Limited employee access with audit logs
- **Compliance**: SOC 2, HIPAA (with BAAs), and other certifications
- **Convenience**: Requires corporate setup, limited device access

#### TapTrust Advantage
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Your conversations are encrypted on your device before transmission
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Even TapTrust cannot decrypt your conversations
- **Universal Access**: Sign in from any device with just email or Google account
- **No Setup Required**: Enterprise-level privacy without corporate overhead
- **Hardware Security**: AI processing happens in secure enclaves (TEEs)

TapTrust delivers the convenience of consumer AI services with privacy that exceeds even the most secure enterprise offerings.

### Is TapTrust compliant with regulations affecting my industry?

**Yes, TapTrust's architecture provides superior compliance through technical design rather than policy adherence.**

TapTrust's zero-knowledge architecture inherently satisfies most privacy regulations because we cannot access your data even if required by law. This provides stronger protection than traditional compliance approaches.

#### Key Compliance Benefits:
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data remains encrypted end-to-end; TapTrust cannot be a business associate because we cannot access PHI
- **GDPR**: Data minimization by design; right to deletion is technically enforced through encryption
- **SOC 2**: Zero-trust architecture exceeds standard security controls
- **CJIS**: Law enforcement data protected through hardware-level security
- **FedRAMP**: Government-grade security through secure enclaves and encryption

#### Traditional AI Services vs. TapTrust:
- **Policy-Based**: Other services rely on contracts, audits, and access controls
- **Technical**: TapTrust uses cryptography to make data access impossible
- **Risk**: Policy compliance can fail; technical compliance cannot be bypassed
- **Scope**: Traditional compliance covers specific use cases; TapTrust protects all data universally

This technical approach to compliance reduces legal risk and often eliminates the need for complex business associate agreements or data processing addendums.

### Can I restore my chat history?

**Yes, you can access your previous chats and messages from any device using the same login credentials.**

Your chat history is stored in encrypted form on TapTrust servers. The encryption key needed to decrypt this data is only available on your client devices when you log in with your credentials.

#### How It Works:
1. **Cross-Device Access**: Log in with the same email or Google account to access your chat history
2. **Automatic Decryption**: Your device automatically derives the encryption key from your login
3. **Seamless Sync**: All your conversations appear across all your devices
4. **Offline Access**: Once synced, conversations are cached locally for offline viewing

#### Important Notes:
- **Login Method Matters**: Using Google sign-in vs. email sign-in creates separate accounts, even with the same email address
- **No Password Recovery**: Since we cannot decrypt your data, lost login credentials mean lost access to chat history
- **Device Independence**: No need to transfer keys between devices—your login credentials are sufficient

#### Account Types:
- **Email Login**: Uses your email address and Privy's secure authentication
- **Google Login**: Uses Google OAuth with the same privacy protections
- **Different Accounts**: Google Workspace email via Google sign-in ≠ same email via email sign-in

Your chat history remains completely private while being conveniently accessible across all your devices.

### Can I share chats?

**Yes, Pro accounts include secure chat sharing that maintains end-to-end encryption.**

TapTrust's chat sharing feature is designed for professional collaboration while preserving the privacy guarantees that make TapTrust unique.

#### How Secure Sharing Works:
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Shared chats remain encrypted throughout the sharing process
- **Granular Control**: Share specific conversations, not your entire chat history
- **Private Links**: Shared chats are only accessible through private, non-indexable links
- **No Public Access**: Shared content is never publicly accessible or indexed by search engines
- **Recipient Encryption**: Recipients receive their own encrypted copy of the shared conversation

#### Pro Account Features:
- **Team Collaboration**: Share conversations with team members securely
- **Client Sharing**: Share relevant AI conversations with clients while maintaining privacy
- **Audit Trail**: Track who has accessed shared conversations
- **Expiration Controls**: Set time limits on shared chat access
- **Revoke Access**: Remove access to shared chats at any time

#### Privacy Guarantees:
- **No Metadata Leakage**: Sharing doesn't expose conversation metadata to TapTrust
- **Recipient Privacy**: Shared conversations are encrypted for each recipient
- **Search Engine Protection**: Shared links are protected from web crawlers and indexing
- **Enterprise Security**: Same security standards as private conversations

This approach enables collaboration without compromising the fundamental privacy that makes TapTrust secure.

## Technical Questions

### What happens if TapTrust shuts down?

Your encrypted data remains accessible through standard backup and export tools. Since your conversations are encrypted with keys derived from your login credentials, you maintain control over your data independently of TapTrust's services.

### Can I use TapTrust offline?

Yes, once your conversations are synced to a device, you can view them offline. New conversations require an internet connection for AI processing, but your existing chat history remains accessible.

### What AI models does TapTrust support?

TapTrust primarily uses advanced reasoning models like DeepSeek R1 through Tinfoil's secure infrastructure. All models are accessed through the same privacy-preserving architecture.

### How does TapTrust handle file attachments?

File attachments are encrypted using the same client-side encryption as your messages. Supported file types include documents, images, and code files, all processed securely within trusted execution environments.

## Account & Billing

### Is TapTrust free to use?

TapTrust offers both free and Pro tiers. Free accounts include basic secure conversations with usage limits. Pro accounts add features like chat sharing, increased usage limits, and priority support.

### How do I upgrade to Pro?

You can upgrade to Pro directly from your TapTrust account settings. Pro subscriptions are managed through secure billing partners and can be cancelled at any time.

### What payment methods are accepted?

TapTrust accepts major credit cards and digital payment methods through secure, industry-standard payment processors that don't have access to your conversation data.
