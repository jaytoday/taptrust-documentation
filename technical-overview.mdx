## How TapTrust Works

TapTrust uses a combination of cutting-edge technologies to provide truly private AI conversations. This technical overview explains the architecture that makes it possible.

## Core Technologies

### Secure Enclaves for Authentication

TapTrust uses [Privy](https://privy.io) for secure, privacy-focused authentication. Privy provides:

- **Cross-platform login** with email, phone number and Google OAuth
- **Deterministic key derivation** from user identity
- **No wallet complexity** - simplified authentication flow
- **Privacy-first design** that doesn't collect unnecessary data

### Secure AI Inference

For AI processing, TapTrust integrates with [Tinfoil](https://tinfoil.sh), which provides:

- **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)** for AI inference
- **Hardware-level isolation** protecting conversations during processing
- **Verifiable computing** with cryptographic proof of secure execution
- **No data persistence** - conversations are never stored on AI servers

### End-to-End Encryption

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="lock" title="Client-Side Encryption">
    All messages are encrypted on your device using AES-GCM encryption before being transmitted. The encryption key is derived deterministically from your user identity, ensuring the same key is available on all your devices.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Zero-Knowledge Storage">
    TapTrust servers store only encrypted message blobs. Even with full database access, your conversations remain unreadable without your personal encryption key.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="shield" title="Secure Processing">
    When AI inference is needed, your encrypted messages are processed within secure enclaves that prevent even the cloud provider from accessing the plaintext data.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Data Flow

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="user" title="1. Authentication">
    You authenticate with Privy using email or Google. A deterministic encryption key is derived from your user ID, ensuring consistent access across devices.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="message" title="2. Message Encryption">
    Your message is encrypted on your device before being saved to TapTrust's encrypted storage. The server never sees your plaintext message.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="cpu" title="3. AI Processing">
    A short-lived API key is generated to access Tinfoil's secure AI inference. Your encrypted message is processed within a trusted execution environment.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="reply" title="4. Secure Response">
    The AI response is generated within the secure enclave and encrypted before being sent back to your device, where it's decrypted and displayed.

## Privacy Guarantees

### What TapTrust Cannot See
- Your conversation content
- Your message attachments
- Your AI responses
- Your search queries or tool usage

### What TapTrust Can See
- Encrypted message blobs (unreadable without your key)
- Message timestamps and metadata
- Usage statistics and error logs
- Billing and account information

This architecture ensures that even in the event of a data breach or legal request, your conversations remain private and secure.
